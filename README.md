Join us for SaturPlay, a morning of hands-on science, technology, and play for MIT alumni, friends, and their families. Join MIT Open Learning and the MIT Club of New York at the Speyer Legacy School to experience MIT’s pK-12 curriculum, which brings MIT’s mens et manus spirit to children and pK-12 educators through project-based learning activities.
     
The morning’s activities will be designed for students in grades 5–7. In small groups kids will participate in activities featuring MIT’s project-based learning approach with the help of an MIT facilitator. The day will culminate with a showcase and reception where kids will have the chance to share what they learned with parents and friends, and all guests will be invited to connect with MIT facilitators and representatives from the MIT pK-12 Action Group. 
    
We welcome parents and interested alumni and friends to attend the full event or just the student showcase. Adult attendees are also invited to attend an info session about how to get involved with MIT’s pK-12 community.
